Description: We present HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) for integration
    of multiple data views while accounting for subgroup heterogeneity to identify
    common and subgroup-specific variables of interest for a particular outcome. HIP accommodates Gaussian,
    multi-class, Poisson, and zero-inflated Poisson outcomes. In addition to
    this package, HIP may be accessed through an R Shiny application found at 
    <https://multi-viewlearn.shinyapps.io/HIP_ShinyApp/>.
